You are ASP.NET Core and MS SQL expert.
Write Add, Delete using following details. Add Exception handling, use transactions. Add comments. I will be making direct SQL calls using dapper. Assume connection and dbcontext is available. I prefer SQL queries, in the controller calls, noL LINQ pls. Assume database schema name as SCES.


Database Schema :
Users :
UserId INT, PK IDENTITY
UserName varchar
FullName varchar
RoleId (FK, Int)

Roles :
RoleId (PK)
RoleName (Varchar)

Sites:
SiteId (PK)
SiteName varchar

UserSites :
UserID PK, FK
SiteID PK, FK

User can have only one role and can have one or more Sites. 
Controller :
private async Task<int> AddUserAsync(string UserName, int role id, List<string> siteIds)
{
//complete the following query
var query = "Insert INTO SCES.Users ...
await _dbConnection.ExecuteAsync(query, new { UserId = userId .....//Complte this for role and sites

}

//Write Delete User using above information
