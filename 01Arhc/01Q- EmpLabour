I have provided scema for all the tables to you earlier.
The INSERT statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY constraint "FK_ArchVehEmployeeLabour". The conflict occurred in database "CES", table "SBCES.ArchVeh
I have modified SQL like (note changes for ArchVehicleListId) :
INSERT INTO [SBCES].[ArchVehEmployeeLabour] (
    [LabourDefn],
    [DateEntered],
    [LinkNumber],
    [TypeId],
    [Costcentre],
    [Task],
    [LabourType],
    [Usage],
    [HrsReqd],
    [AdjHrs],
    [TimeAddition],
    [ArchVehicleListId]
)
SELECT
    el.[LabourDefn],
    el.[DateEntered],
    el.[LinkNumber],
    el.[TypeId],
    el.[CostCentre],  -- Maps to target's Costcentre (case-insensitive)
    el.[Task],
    CAST(el.[LabourType] AS VARCHAR(5)),  -- Required type conversion
    el.[Usage],
    el.[HrsReqd],
    el.[AdjHrs],
    el.[TimeAddition],
	el.LinkNumber
  
FROM [SBCES].[EmployeeLabour] el

WHERE
    TRY_CAST(LTRIM(RTRIM(el.[LinkNumber])) AS INT) IS NOT NULL
	AND [LinkNumber] = '4321'
