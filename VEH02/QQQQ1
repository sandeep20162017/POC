You are asp.net core and Telerik asp.net core expert.
Index.chtml 
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Vehicle Estimate";
    var parentGridId = $"{ViewBag.PartNum}";/* save gridname in hidden field for JS */
    var vehGridName = $"VehicleGrid_{ViewBag.PartNum}";

   // var vehGridName = $"VehicleGrid";
}

How can I use parentGridId in the javascript in the same Index.cshtml?
Getting error parentGridId is not defined.
