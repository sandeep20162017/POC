sql
SELECT owner, name AS procedure_name, type
FROM dba_dependencies
WHERE referenced_name = 'TEMP_MATERIALS_LIST'
  AND referenced_type = 'TABLE'
  AND type IN ('PROCEDURE', 'PACKAGE BODY');
Limitation: Only detects static references. Dynamic SQL or session-specific writes are missed 69.

2. Search PL/SQL Code for References
Scan source code for mentions of the table:

sql
SELECT owner, name AS object_name, type, line, text
FROM dba_source
WHERE UPPER(text) LIKE '%TEMP_MATERIALS_LIST%';
Key Filters:

Add AND type IN ('PROCEDURE', 'PACKAGE BODY').

Use regex for complex patterns (e.g., INSERT INTO TEMP_MATERIALS_LIST).
Caution: May return false positives (e.g., comments) 912.

3. Check Triggers on Related Tables
If TEMP_MATERIALS_LIST is populated by triggers from other tables:

sql
SELECT trigger_name, table_name, action_type
FROM dba_triggers
WHERE trigger_body LIKE '%TEMP_MATERIALS_LIST%';
