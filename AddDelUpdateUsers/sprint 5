Here are 7 actionable tasks for your sprint board to implement SSO and logging mechanisms:

---

### **1. Research & Document SSO Integration Requirements**  
- Identify supported SSO providers (e.g., Google, Microsoft, SAML).  
- Outline authentication flows (OAuth2/OpenID Connect).  
- Define user role mappings and security requirements.  

---

### **2. Implement SSO Backend Integration**  
- Develop API endpoints for SSO authentication callbacks.  
- Integrate token validation and user data synchronization with the identity provider.  
- Add encryption for sensitive data (e.g., tokens, user info).  

---

### **3. Update UI for SSO Login Options**  
- Add SSO login buttons/links to the login screen.  
- Handle error states (e.g., failed authentication).  
- Update session management to support SSO and local login coexistence.  

---

### **4. Design & Implement Database Logging**  
- Create a logging schema (timestamp, user ID, action, severity, metadata).  
- Develop backend services to capture critical events (e.g., logins, errors, transactions).  
- Ensure sensitive data is masked/anonymized in logs.  

---

### **5. Build Logs Dashboard in UI**  
- Create an admin-only UI page to display logs.  
- Add filters (date, user, severity) and search functionality.  
- Implement pagination and export options (e.g., CSV/PDF).  

---

### **6. Update UI Labels and Tooltips for Logging Clarity**  
- Audit and refine labels for user actions that trigger logging (e.g., "Delete Account").  
- Add tooltips/descriptions explaining logged events to end-users.  
- Ensure consistency in terminology across the UI.  

---

### **7. Write Documentation & Test Cases**  
- Document SSO setup steps for admins (e.g., provider configuration).  
- Create a user guide for accessing and interpreting logs.  
- Write unit/integration tests for SSO and logging features.
