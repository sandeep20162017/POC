You are asp.net  8.0 and Telerik ASp.net core UI expert. My application uses Telerik ASp.NET core grid, and uses inline edit. I need to restrict user to enter any special characters like (*&^%@!"'?/,:;{]{+=)(^%/) in a few of the columns.Suggest best practise  to implement  this (may be client template or global JS)? User should be notified immidialtly when these specail characters are entered (hopeffuuly not when user clicks on any botton. AJAX.
