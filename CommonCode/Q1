You are ASP.NET core (v 8.0) and Telerik ASP.NET Core expert.
I am using Telerik ASp.NET core grid control for three grids -(VehileGrid, MakeVsBuyGrid, RBPartsGrid). All the three grids have
CRUD functionality. App uses dapper SQL calls. No services. Assume _dbContext is available
Each grid has model, view and controller.
When user clicks on any row of the grid, application opens 2 Telerik tabs - LabourDetails and TotalCost.
LabourDetails and TotalCost are rendered using Telerik Grid. LabourDetails and TotalCost also have their own controllers.
I want to reuse these LabourDetails and TotalCost controller actions (just change the SQL code depending on VehileGrid, MakeVsBuyGrid, RBPartsGrid.
Can you pls help implement GetMaterialCostSummaryInRbPartsData function below? I have also put the notes for you in the following code snippet. Show me easy functionality to implement the function.
Example :
TotalCost.chtml grid action : //note keep this the same, no change
 .Read(read => read.Url(Url.Action("GetMaterialCostSummaryInRbParts", "MaterialCostSummaryInRbParts") + "?rebuiltPartNum=" + ViewBag.RebuiltPartNum).Type(HttpVerbs.Get))
MaterialCostSummaryInRbPartsController.cs :
public async Task<JsonResult> GetMaterialCostSummaryInRbParts([DataSourceRequest] DataSourceRequest request, [FromQuery] string rebuiltPartNum)
//Note no changes here. I will rename string rebuiltPartNum to string partNum. PartNum will be rebuiltPartNum for RBPartsGrid, MbNumber for MakeVsBuyGrid, vehileNumbr for VehileGrid
{
var model = await GetMaterialCostSummaryInRbPartsData(rebuiltPartNum);
return Json(model.ToDataSourceResult(request));
}
Private async Task<IEnumerable<MaterialCostSummaryInRbViewModel>> GetMaterialCostSummaryInRbPartsData(string RebuiltPartNum)
            {
                //Note :Need to call differnt SQL query here based on which grid user is calling this controller action
           //example if you are here from VehileGrid - call "select * from VehicleList"
           //if you are here from MakeVsBuyGrid call "select * from MbList"
           //if you are here from RBPartsGrid, call "select * from RBList"
  }
