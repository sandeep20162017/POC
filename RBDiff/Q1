You are ASP.NET Core v 8.0 and Telerik (Kendo)  ASp NET Core expert.
I need your expert openion to implement following logig using Telerik grid and tabstrip controls.

Need to implement Telerick grid - Call it Archieved RB Parts. On get, it will get the data based on RebuiltParts numberversion as PK. On expansion of any row, it should open 5 tab strips (labour details, Labour Hour, Material cost, Material SC parts, Material NSC parts, Material RB Part, Total cost). Sample implementation is below.

I need ability to compare any two rows from the grid. Example, 
Row 1 is = RebuiltParts numberversion-1, which will have all the tab strips labour details, Labour Hour, Material cost, Material SC parts, Material NSC parts, Material RB Part, Total cost)
Row2 is = RebuiltParts numberversion-2, which will have all the tab strips labour details, Labour Hour, Material cost, Material SC parts, Material NSC parts, Material RB Part, Total cost)
Row3 is = RebuiltParts numberversion-3, which will have all the tab strips labour details, Labour Hour, Material cost, Material SC parts, Material NSC parts, Material RB Part, Total cost)
Row4 is = RebuiltParts numberversion-3, which will have all the tab strips labour details, Labour Hour, Material cost, Material SC parts, Material NSC parts, Material RB Part, Total cost)

User can select any two grid rows,  application should show differences/variances in all the tabl strips labour details, Labour Hour, Material cost, Material SC parts, Material NSC parts, Material RB Part, Total cost).
My question is how to display this comaprison variance on the screen? Consider better UI experience. Suggest multiple designs.
