Step 1: Update the Grid Configuration
Modify the Destroy configuration in the grid to include the UserID in the URL:

csharp
Copy
// In Index.cshtml
.Destroy(delete => delete
    .Url(Url.Action("DeleteUser", "UserManagementGrid", new { userID = "{0}" }))
    .Type(HttpVerbs.Post)
The {0} placeholder will be replaced with the UserID from the grid's model.

Step 2: Ensure the Model ID is Configured
The grid must know which field is the unique identifier (primary key). In your DataSource model, ensure UserID is marked as the Id:

csharp
Copy
// In Index.cshtml
.Model(model => {
    model.Id(u => u.UserID); // This maps {0} to UserID
    // ... other fields
})
Step 3: Update the Controller Action
Modify the DeleteUser action to accept the UserID from the query string or route:

csharp
Copy
[HttpPost]
[AllowAnonymous]
public async Task<IActionResult> DeleteUser(int userID)
{
    try
    {
        await DeleteUserAsync(userID);
        return Json(new { success = true });
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        return StatusCode(500, "An error occurred while deleting the user.");
    }
}
Step 4: Handle Anti-Forgery Tokens (Optional)
If you have anti-forgery validation enabled, include the token in the delete request. Add this to your JavaScript:

javascript
Copy
// In Index.cshtml
$(document).ready(function() {
    // Add anti-forgery token to all AJAX requests
    $.ajaxPrefilter(function(options, originalOptions, jqXHR) {
        if (options.type.toUpperCase() === "POST") {
            jqXHR.setRequestHeader(
                "RequestVerificationToken",
                $('input[name="__RequestVerificationToken"]').val()
            );
        }
    });
});
Why This Works
No Batch Mode Needed: The delete operation is treated as a standalone request (not part of a batch), so the DeleteUser action is called directly.

Simple URL Binding: The UserID is passed via the URL (e.g., /UserManagementGrid/DeleteUser?userID=123), avoiding complex model binding.

Compatibility: Works seamlessly with InCell editing since deletions are immediate (no need to click "Save").
