Fix: Chain all events in one .Events(...) block:
csharp
Copy
Edit
.Events(events => events
    .DataBound("onRbGridDataBound")
    .Edit("onGridEditLockHandler")
)
‚úÖ Important for InCell Editing:
InCell edit mode behaves differently. The .Edit() event only fires when a new editor widget (ComboBox, etc.) is instantiated, not just when you click a cell.

That means:

Edit will not fire for plain text inputs.

For a column using EditorTemplateName("ComboBoxEditor"), it will fire.

If you want to apply read-only logic consistently across all cell types, not just ComboBoxes:

You might need to also use .CellClose() or .Save() events.

Or you can apply logic in DataBound after editors are initialized.

üîç Check if your column is using EditorTemplateName(...)
Only these types will trigger the Edit event in InCell mode.

If RebuiltStockNum, KeyWord, Description are plain inputs with no editor templates, .Edit() won‚Äôt fire.
