Try helping me to migrate following oracle query to MS SQL qury.
Oracle and MS SQL schema match.
Difference is in the naming convention. Oracle quey table and column names use sname case, mS SQL 
schema naming onvention is CamelCase.
Use schema name SBCES in MS SQL query
Oracle query
SELECT
            UPPER(mms_stock_code) AS mms_stock_code,
            UPPER(rebuilt_stock_num) AS rebuilt_stock_num,
            UPPER(job_number) AS job_number,
            UPPER(keyword) AS keyword,
            UPPER(detailed_desc) AS detailed_desc,
            UPPER(core_charge) AS core_charge,
            UPPER(rebuilt_stock_num) AS rebuilt_stock_num,
            UPPER(core_part_num) AS core_part_num,
            UPPER(mms_stock_code) AS mms_stock_code,
            UPPER(sop_number) AS sop_number,
            UPPER(buy_new_cost) AS buy_new_cost,
