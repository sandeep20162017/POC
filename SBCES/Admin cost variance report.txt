Generate script for cost variance report.
It should have Rebuild number, Keyword, Description Internal cost, buy new cost and variance. You may need to calculate variance

SELECT 
    RBM.RebuiltStockNum AS RebuildNumber,
    KM.Keyword,
    KM.DetailedDesc AS Description,
    CAST(RBM.RemanCost AS DECIMAL(20, 2)) AS InternalCost,
    CAST(RBM.BuyNewCost AS DECIMAL(20, 2)) AS BuyNewCost,
    CAST(RBM.BuyNewCost AS DECIMAL(20, 2)) - CAST(RBM.RemanCost AS DECIMAL(20, 2)) AS Variance,
    ((CAST(RBM.BuyNewCost AS DECIMAL(20, 2)) - CAST(RBM.RemanCost AS DECIMAL(20, 2))) / CAST(RBM.BuyNewCost AS DECIMAL(20, 2))) * 100 AS VariancePercentage

    SCES.RbMasterlist RBM

    SCES.KitsMasterlist KM ON RBM.corepartnum = KM.PartNo;
