Labor Cost = (Hours Required × Labor Rate) × Usage Percentage
Material Cost = (Quantity × Unit Cost) × Usage Percentage
Overhead Cost = Labor Cost × Overhead Rate
Fringe Cost = Labor Cost × Fringe Rate
Total Labor Cost = Sum of all labor costs
Total Material Cost = Sum of all material costs
Core Cost = Core charge (if applicable)
Subtotal = Total Labor Cost + Total Material Cost - Core Cost
Overhead Cost = Total Labor Cost × Overhead Rate
Fringe Cost = Total Labor Cost × Fringe Rate
Total Cost = Subtotal + Overhead Cost + Fringe Cost
Tax = Total Material Cost × Tax Rate
Final Estimate = Total Cost + Tax

The application uses either overhead or fringe values, depending on the configuration.
The setting g_str_UseOverheadFringe determines whether overhead or fringe is used :
If g_str_UseOverheadFringe = "F", the application uses fringe values.
If g_str_UseOverheadFringe = "O", the application uses overhead values.

Example Calculation
If the labor cost is $100 and the overhead rate is 20%:
Overhead Cost = $100 × 20% = $20

If the labor cost is $100 and the fringe rate is 15%:
Fringe Cost = $100 × 15% = $15

Additional business rules:

Labor Overhead and Fringe:
Overhead and Fringe values must be between 0 and 2.

Non-Productive Adjustment:
Non-productive adjustment must be a positive number or zero.

Tax Rate:
Tax rate must be between 0 and 1.

Converting MB to RB
Trigger:
The user selects an MB part and provides a new rebuilt part number and MMS stock code.

Data Copying:
Materials, labor tasks, and bus associations are copied from the MB part to the RB part.

Validation:
The application checks if the rebuilt part number already exists in the RB_MASTERLIST table.
