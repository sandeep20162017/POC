Vehicle is the main row. When expanded it has vaious tabs. TotalGrid is the last tab.
When user clicks on Archive (when on the other tabs, other than tab containing TotalCostGrid),  JS  error is thrown :
TotalCost grid with ID #TotalCostInRbModelGrid_4350 not found.
#TotalCostInRbModelGrid_4350 gets rendered when user clicks on TotalCost tab, JS passes good payload when User clicks on TotalCost and then clicks on Archive button
