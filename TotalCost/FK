Following :
SELECT 
    fk.name AS ConstraintName,
    OBJECT_NAME(fk.parent_object_id) AS SourceTable,
    OBJECT_NAME(fk.referenced_object_id) AS TargetTable
FROM 
    sys.foreign_keys AS fk
WHERE 
    OBJECT_NAME(fk.parent_object_id) = 'EmplClass'   -- Source table (EmplClass)
    AND OBJECT_NAME(fk.referenced_object_id) = 'EmployeeSalaries'  -- Target table (EmployeeSalaries)
    AND SCHEMA_NAME(fk.schema_id) = 'SBCES';  -- Schema name
returned :
ConstraintName	SourceTable	TargetTable
FK_WageGroup_	EmplClass	EmployeeSalaries
FK_WageGroup	EmplClass	EmployeeSalaries

Is it possible to delete FK, insert and then again add contraint?
