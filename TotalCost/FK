Troubleshooting if No Results Are Returned:
1. Check Schema and Table Names
Verify the schema name is exactly SBCES (case-sensitive in some environments).

Confirm the tables are named EmplClass and EmployeeSalaries in the schema SBCES.

2. Check for Typographical Errors
Use brackets for tables with spaces/special characters:

sql
Copy
WHERE 
    OBJECT_NAME(fk.parent_object_id) = 'EmplClass'
    AND OBJECT_NAME(fk.referenced_object_id) = 'EmployeeSalaries'
3. Check Constraint Existence
Run this broader query to list all foreign keys in the SBCES schema:

sql
Copy
SELECT 
    fk.name AS ConstraintName,
    OBJECT_NAME(fk.parent_object_id) AS SourceTable,
    OBJECT_NAME(fk.referenced_object_id) AS TargetTable
FROM 
    sys.foreign_keys AS fk
WHERE 
    SCHEMA_NAME(fk.schema_id) = 'SBCES';
4. Use Object IDs for Accuracy
sql
Copy
SELECT 
    fk.name AS ConstraintName,
    OBJECT_NAME(fk.parent_object_id) AS SourceTable,
    OBJECT_NAME(fk.referenced_object_id) AS TargetTable
FROM 
    sys.foreign_keys AS fk
WHERE 
    fk.parent_object_id = OBJECT_ID('SBCES.EmplClass')  -- Parent table
    AND fk.referenced_object_id = OBJECT_ID('SBCES.EmployeeSalaries');  -- Referenced table
Example Fix for Your Script:
Once you have the actual constraint name (e.g., FK_WageGroup_EmplClass_Salaries), use it in your script:

sql
Copy
-- Drop the constraint
ALTER TABLE [SBCES].[EmplClass]
DROP CONSTRAINT [FK_WageGroup_EmplClass_Salaries]; -- ðŸ‘ˆ Replace with actual name

-- Perform your DELETE/INSERT operations...

-- Recreate the constraint
ALTER TABLE [SBCES].[EmplClass]
ADD CONSTRAINT [FK_WageGroup_EmplClass_Salaries] 
FOREIGN KEY ([WageGroup]) 
REFERENCES [SBCES].[EmployeeSalaries] ([WageGroup]);
Key Notes:
Replace FK_WageGroup_EmplClass_Salaries with the actual constraint name from your query results.
