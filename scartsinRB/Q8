You are Oracle and MS SQL expert. I need your help to migrate Below oracle query to MS SQL.
Following Query is written in Oracle. I have already creatd a new schema in MS SQL.
Table, column and function names match in Oracle and MS SQL.
Only difference is the naming convention, MS SQL Table, column and function name are without underscore.
Example Oracle : SC_PARTS_USED MS SQL : SCPARTSUSED
Oracle : FINAL_COST MS SQL : FINALCOST
--On MS SQL use following logic for casting FINALCost (use just logic)
  CAST(SBCES.FINALCOST(
     CAST(PERCENTUSAGE AS NUMERIC(18,2)), 
     CAST(QTYREQD AS NUMERIC(18,2)), 
     MMSCOST, 
     0
 ) AS DECIMAL(18,2)) AS TAXCOST

 DECLARE @RebuiltPartNum VARCHAR(30) = '035434' 
SELECT UPPER(SC_PARTS_USED.MMS_STOCK_CODE) , 
NVL(SC_PARTS_USED.MMS_COST,0) AS UnitCost,
UPPER(SC_PARTS_USED.QTY_REQD) AS "QTY",
REPLACE(SC_PARTS_USED.PERCENT_USAGE,',','.') AS [Percentage], 
REPLACE(FINAL_COST(SC_PARTS_USED.PERCENT_USAGE, SC_PARTS_USED.QTY_REQD,SC_PARTS_USED.CORECOST,0),',','.') AS "CORECOST",
REPLACE(FINAL_COST(SC_PARTS_USED.PERCENT_USAGE, SC_PARTS_USED.QTY_REQD, SC_PARTS_USED.MMS_COST, 0),',','.') AS "TOTALCOST",
UPPER(SC_PARTS_USED.COST_CENTRE) AS "CC", NVL(UPPER(STOCK_CODED_PARTS.DETAILED_DESC),'') AS "DESCRIPTION",
NVL(UPPER(STOCK_CODED_PARTS.PART_TYPE),'') AS "KEYWORD", 
SC_PARTS_USED.OEM_COST AS "OEM COST", SC_PARTS_USED.MMS_REBUILT_CODE AS "MMSREBUILTCODE", 
SC_PARTS_USED.REB_PART_COST AS "REBUILT PART COST", UPPER(SC_PARTS_USED.REBUILT_PART) AS "REBUILTPART", 
SC_PARTS_USED.ROWID FROM SC_PARTS_USED, STOCK_CODED_PARTS WHERE SC_PARTS_USED.LINK_CODE = @RebuiltPartNum 
--AND SC_PARTS_USED.REBUILT_PART = '035434'
 AND SC_PARTS_USED.LINK_TYPE = 'RB' AND STOCK_CODED_PARTS.MMS_STOCK_CODE (+)= SC_PARTS_USED.MMS_STOCK_CODE ORDER BY SC_PARTS_USED.MMS_STOCK_CODE
