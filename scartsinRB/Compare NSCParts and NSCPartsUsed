Also, remind the user to replace the table names if they used different ones, just in case. And maybe add a note about checking for duplicates within each table before proceeding, as that could skew results.

Finally, think about how to present the answer: start with the problem, outline different methods, provide code examples, and mention performance considerations. Make sure it's clear and addresses all parts of the user's question.

Here's a SQL solution to analyze the IDs between the two tables using set operations and joins:

1. Common IDs (Exists in Both Tables)
sql
Copy
-- Using INNER JOIN
SELECT n.ID AS CommonID
FROM NSCPARTS n
INNER JOIN NSCPARTSUSED nu ON n.ID = nu.ID;

-- Using INTERSECT
SELECT ID FROM NSCPARTS
INTERSECT
SELECT ID FROM NSCPARTSUSED;
2. IDs Existing Only in NSCPARTS
sql
Copy
-- Using LEFT JOIN
SELECT n.ID AS NSCPARTS_Only
FROM NSCPARTS n
LEFT JOIN NSCPARTSUSED nu ON n.ID = nu.ID
WHERE nu.ID IS NULL;

-- Using EXCEPT
SELECT ID FROM NSCPARTS
EXCEPT
SELECT ID FROM NSCPARTSUSED;
3. IDs Existing Only in NSCPARTSUSED
sql
Copy
-- Using RIGHT JOIN
SELECT nu.ID AS NSCPARTSUSED_Only
FROM NSCPARTS n
RIGHT JOIN NSCPARTSUSED nu ON n.ID = nu.ID
WHERE n.ID IS NULL;

-- Using EXCEPT
SELECT ID FROM NSCPARTSUSED
EXCEPT
SELECT ID FROM NSCPARTS;
4. Complete Analysis in Single Query
sql
Copy
SELECT 
    COALESCE(n.ID, nu.ID) AS ID,
    CASE 
        WHEN n.ID IS NOT NULL AND nu.ID IS NOT NULL THEN 'Exists in Both'
        WHEN n.ID IS NOT NULL THEN 'Exists Only in NSCPARTS'
        ELSE 'Exists Only in NSCPARTSUSED'
    END AS Status
FROM NSCPARTS n
FULL OUTER JOIN NSCPARTSUSED nu ON n.ID = nu.ID
ORDER BY ID;
5. Count Summary
sql
Copy
SELECT 
    Status,
    COUNT(*) AS Count
FROM (
    SELECT 
        COALESCE(n.ID, nu.ID) AS ID,
        CASE 
            WHEN n.ID IS NOT NULL AND nu.ID IS NOT NULL THEN 'Both'
            WHEN n.ID IS NOT NULL THEN 'NSCPARTS Only'
            ELSE 'NSCPARTSUSED Only'
        END AS Status
    FROM NSCPARTS n
    FULL OUTER JOIN NSCPARTSUSED nu ON n.ID = nu.ID
) AS Summary
GROUP BY Status;
