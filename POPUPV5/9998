You are ASP.NET core, Telerik ASP.NET core, css and UI.UX expert.
I need your assiatnce in refactoing folowing code
In the existing (below code), Index.cshtml uses grid. When user clicks on Estimate#, _VehPopUp gets renderd. 
This _VehPopUp is clinet template of another Telerik grid.
Changes I need :
 Add addional layer - betewwn Index.cshtml and _VelPopUp.cshtml. Call it _VehEstimatePopUp.cshtml
 When user clicks on Estimate# tab, Instead of poping up _VelPopUp, _VehEstimatePopUp should be poped up.
 _VehEstimatePopUp should have  tabs - Vehicle, PartDetails, Labour Details, Stock Coded Parts, Non tock Coded Parts, Rebuilt Parts, Final Estimate tabs. 
 Vehicle tab is the first tab and should be active when _VehicleEstimatePopUp.cshtml. is rendered
 Each tab has its own telerik grid, with CRUD, so it will have its Add, Edit, Update.
 Existing :
 Index->VehPopup
 New
 Index->New Vehicle Estimate (PopUp)->First tab should render _VelPopUp.cshtml
 Index->>New Vehicle Estimate (PopUp)->PartDetails->write JS stub with alert(xx clicked). I will fill it in later
 same for other tabs.
 Shouer should be able to click on any tab and contents must be loaded using AJAX. 
 Need simpler but nice UI/UX eperience.
 Pls prive all the chnaged files separatlty.
