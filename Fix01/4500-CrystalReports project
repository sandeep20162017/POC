Done — I created the ready-made ZIP skeleton for you and placed it here:

Download CES + ReportHost skeleton (CESReports.zip)

What’s inside

CES/ — ASP.NET Core 8 front-end skeleton (project file, Program.cs, simple Reports controller and Razor views). Configure appsettings.json → ReportHost:BaseUrl.

CESReports/ — .NET Framework 4.8 Report Host skeleton (Web API controller api/reports/pdf, Reports folder for .rpt files, Web.config with DB appSettings).

READMEs with step-by-step setup and deployment notes.

Next steps (quick checklist)

Install SAP Crystal Reports .NET Runtime (CRRuntime_64bit_13_0_xxx.msi) on the machine where CESReports will run.

Open CESReports/CESReports.csproj in Visual Studio (target .NET Framework 4.8). Add references to the Crystal assemblies from:
C:\Program Files (x86)\SAP BusinessObjects\Crystal Reports for .NET Framework 4.0\assemblies\v4.0\

Copy your .rpt files into CESReports/Reports.

Edit CESReports/Web.config appSettings to point to your SQL Server credentials.

Run CESReports in IIS/IIS Express on the port in Web.config (default 5005).

Edit CES/appsettings.json if needed to point ReportHost:BaseUrl to the running report host.

Run CES (dotnet run) and navigate to /Reports then click the sample Invoice link.
