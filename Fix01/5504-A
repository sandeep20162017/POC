Justification for Scope Carryover to 2026
Additional scope for non-revenue vehicles: New requirements were introduced to support estimates for non-revenue vehicles. These were not part of the original plan and require additional development and testing.

Enhanced quality standards: To ensure a stable and reliable release, we implemented stricter quality checks. As a result, some items—such as the redesigned user interface, database cleanup, and data query improvements—were deferred.

Expanded reporting and finance scope: New reports and audit-ready estimates were added based on updated financial data. This required new logic, validation, and testing effort.

Increased workload from infrastructure initiatives: Engineering and QA resources were also allocated to support Windows 11 migration, Oracle upgrades, and production support, which reduced available capacity for planned features.

December resource constraints: A scheduled 2-week furlough in December reduced engineering and QA availability during a critical delivery period.

Strategic deferral for platform alignment: Certain features were intentionally deferred to align with 2026 platform upgrades, ensuring smoother integration and long-term scalability.
