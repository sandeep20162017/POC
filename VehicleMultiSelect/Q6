Based on your suggetions above, For line :   columns.Template(p =>
Error : Not all code paths return a value in method of type 'type!'
For line :
.Name("Buses_" + p.RebuiltStockNum)
error (for  p.RebuiltStockNum) :
type' does not contain a definition for 'name' and no accessible extension method 'name' accepting a first argument of type 'type' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?).
