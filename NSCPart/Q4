Error for dropdown :
UserManagementGrid:217 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'set')
    at init.onRoleChange (UserManagementGrid:217:30)
All the model fields are still null or empty.
I want to highlight cell which has missing value and is required and not the notification
