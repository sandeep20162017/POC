You are MS SQL expert. Need you help to calculate (UnitCost * QTY * Percentage) AS TotalCost in the below  SQL.
Pls ensure proper casting and null checks
 ISNULL(B.RebPartCost, 0) AS UnitCost, --UnitCost is Neumeric 18,2 in database
 UPPER(B.qtyReqd) AS QTY, -- Is varchar in database, check for null(set to 0 if null)
 REPLACE(B.percentUsage, ',', '.') AS Percentage, -- is varchar in datbase
