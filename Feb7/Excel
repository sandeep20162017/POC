You are Microsoft Excel and VBA Expert. Pls help me to solve following.
In my excel I have 2 worksheets.
1st worksheet is "Sub Project", second worksheet is "Program Budget"
In "Sub Project" I have 3 columns - Type (col B), Cost Element (Col c) and Forcast (Col D)
Cost Element (col c) has rows like :
Sr. Project Manager
Business Analyst (Sandeep Bettoni)
Business Analyst (Rafael Bettoni)
Business Analyst (Sandeep Bettoni)
Business Analyst (Manjot Gill)
Sr. Project Manager
In second worksheet  "Program Budget", has 3 columns - Type (col B), Cost Element (Col c) and Forcast (Col D)
Cost Element (col c) has rows like :
Sr. Project Manager
Project Manager
Project Coordinator 
Solution architect 
Technical Analyst
Business Analyst 
Intune technical resource  
Exchange technical resource
In This "Program Budget" , col Forcast (Col D), I need to add all the Forecast from "Sub Project" in a single row 
(based on the Cost Element (col c) in  "Program Budget" worksheet.
Example in "Sub Project"
Business Analyst (Sandeep Bettoni) assume Forcast is 10
Business Analyst (Rafael Bettoni) assume Forcast is 20
Business Analyst (Rafael Bettoni) assume Forcast is 40
Business Analyst (Sandeep K) assume Forcast is 30
/ (Manjot Gill) assume Forcast is 60
In the program budget sheet, for  Business Analyst,  Forcast (Col D) should be 10+20+s40+30+60. 
Wildcard is 'Business Analyst'. User can add a row in "Sub Project" for 'Business Analyst', and total should be reflected in the 
"Program Budget" worksheet
