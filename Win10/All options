# üîß Windows 11 VB6 App Crash Fix: sysmain.dll / SysMain Service Issue

This document outlines multiple admin-level workarounds to resolve application crashes caused by `sysmain.dll` counter errors after upgrading to Windows 11.

---

## ‚úÖ Option 1: Repair System Files and Performance Counters

### Step 1: Run System File Checker (sfc)

Check for corrupted or missing system files, including `sysmain.dll`:

```cmd
sfc /scannow
```

- This scans all protected system files and attempts to repair any issues using cached copies.
- Generates a report in the CBS log (`C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log`).
- If corruption is found and fixed, **reboot** and check if the issue is resolved.

---

### Step 2: Use DISM (if sfc detects corruption)

If `sfc` finds issues that it cannot repair, use the Deployment Imaging and Servicing Management tool:

```cmd
DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
```

- This downloads clean system files from Windows Update and replaces corrupted system components.
- Follow up with another `sfc /scannow` after running DISM to confirm full repair.

---

### Step 3: Rebuild Performance Counters

```cmd
cd %SystemRoot%\System32
lodctr /R

cd %SystemRoot%\SysWOW64
lodctr /R
```

- These commands rebuild the performance counter registry settings from default `.ini` files.
- The first block repairs 64-bit counters, the second handles 32-bit (needed for VB6 apps).

---

## üîí Option 2: Disable SysMain Performance Counters Only (Not the Service)

Use this registry tweak to prevent loading of `sysmain.dll` into the counter system, without disabling the service:

```reg
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SysMain\Performance]
"Disable Performance Counters"=dword:00000001
```

- Add this as a `.reg` file or set manually using `regedit`.
- Prevents the OS from attempting to load `sysmain.dll` for performance metrics (avoiding the crash).
- **SysMain service stays enabled and functional.**

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Option 3: Disable SysMain Service (Not Recommended by Admin)

Use this only if other fixes fail and admin approves.

### Disable and Stop SysMain:

```powershell
# Disable service from starting at boot
Set-Service -Name "SysMain" -StartupType Disabled

# Stop service immediately
Stop-Service -Name "SysMain" -Force
```

### Re-Enable (Optional Rollback):

```powershell
Set-Service -Name "SysMain" -StartupType Automatic
Start-Service -Name "SysMain"
```

- Fully stops the SysMain service (formerly Superfetch), which prevents `sysmain.dll` from loading at all.
- May affect background optimization and system responsiveness.

## ‚úÖ Recommendation Summary

| Fix Type                         | Affects SysMain? | Safe? | Reboot Needed? | Notes                            |
|----------------------------------|------------------|-------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| sfc /scannow                     | No               | ‚úÖ    | Maybe          | Detects missing/corrupted files |
| DISM /RestoreHealth              | No               | ‚úÖ    | Maybe          | Fixes image corruption          |
| lodctr /R                        | No               | ‚úÖ    | Yes            | Rebuilds counter registry       |
| Registry counter disable         | No (just counters) | ‚úÖ  | Yes            | Keeps SysMain running           |
| Fully disabling SysMain service  | Yes              | ‚ö†Ô∏è    | Yes            | Only if other methods fail      |
