 Option 1: Disable SysMain Service (Recommended)
Have your admin run this PowerShell script as administrator. It safeguards existing service configuration and stops SysMain from automatically restarting after reboot:

powershell
Copy
Edit
# Backup current SysMain startup type
sc.exe qc SysMain | Out-File -FilePath "$env:ProgramData\SysMain-service-backup.txt"

# Disable the SysMain (Superfetch) service
Set-Service -Name "SysMain" -StartupType Disabled

# Stop the service immediately
Stop-Service -Name "SysMain" -Force
The backup file (SysMain-service-backup.txt) allows easy reversal.

This stops the service and prevents it from loading sysmain.dll counters.

It's non-invasive and can be reversed any time.

ðŸ›  Option 2: Rebuild Performance Counters
If you want to keep SysMain enabled in the future, repairing the corrupted performance counter configuration may help:

Admin runs this in an elevated Command Prompt or PowerShell:

batch
Copy
Edit
cd %SystemRoot%\System32
lodctr /R
cd %SystemRoot%\SysWOW64
lodctr /R

DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
sfc /scannow
This resets all performance counters and then repairs Windows components

After reboot, if counters are fully repaired, SysMain should stop throwing that error
