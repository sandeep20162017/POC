Your suggetion worked. Pop is visible after adding dialog.open().
My controller action is like :
public async Task<IActionResult> DeleteLabourDetail(
                            [DataSourceRequest] DataSourceRequest request,
                            [Bind(Prefix = "models")] IEnumerable<LabourDetailsRebuiltPartsViewModel> models,
                             string Id, string gridType)
I don't want to change the parameters. Is there any way to pass model along with I and gridType?
