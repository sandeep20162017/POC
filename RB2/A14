Add this line just before your dataToSend block:

javascript
Copy
Edit
console.log("DEBUG >>>", {
    mmsstockcodeField,
    value: dataItem[mmsstockcodeField],
    dataItem
});
This will show you:

What field name you're trying to pull (mmsstockcodeField)

What value you're getting from dataItem

The full dataItem object

✅ Things to Check
Is the field named exactly MMSStockCode in your ViewModel?
If it’s MmsStockCode, mmsStockCode, or something else — it won’t match. JS is case-sensitive.

Is the field actually populated in the row you clicked?
If the value is null or not loaded in the grid, jQuery skips it during serialization.

✅ Quick Fix Attempt
If you're sure the field exists and is just being skipped, force it:

javascript
Copy
Edit
var mmsValue = dataItem[mmsstockcodeField] || "";

console.log("mmsstockcode to send:", mmsValue);

dataToSend["id"] = dataItem[idField];
dataToSend["mmsstockcode"] = mmsValue;
dataToSend["gridType"] = gridType;
Still seeing it skipped? Try changing the column binding in your Razor:

csharp
Copy
Edit
columns.Bound(c => c.MMSStockCode).IncludeInMenu(false).Hidden(false);
This ensures it’s included in the grid data even if hidden.
