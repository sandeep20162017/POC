1. Get LinkCode and LinkType from RebuiltPartNumber
2. Get Labur details using LinkCode
3. Get Labour Hour Summary (CC, Total of al CC)
4. Get Material Cost Summary (CC, total of all CC)
5. Total costs as per my previous request

How to get LinkCode and LinkType :
SELECT distinct LinkCode, LinkType from [SBCES].[ScPartsUsed] where LinkCode = [SBCES].[RbMasterlist].[RebuiltStockNum] ('035434')
SELECT distinct LinkCode, LinkType from [SBCES].[NScPartsUsed] where LinkCode =[SBCES].[NscPartsUsed][LinkCode]

To get Labour details use :
SELECT el.LabourDefn AS [LABOUR TYPE], 
           el.Costcentre AS [CC], 
           el.Task AS [TASK], 
           REPLACE(el.Usage, ',', '.') AS [USAGE], 
           el.HrsReqd AS [TIME], 
           es.RatePerHour AS [RATE PER HOUR], 
           el.TimeAddition AS [TIME ADDITION]
          -- HHMM_TO_DECIMAL(EmployeeLabour.AdjHrs) AS [WRENCH TIME]
    FROM SBCES.EmployeeLabour el
	JOIN SBCES.EmplClass ec ON el.LabourDefn = UPPER(ec.LabourDefn)
    JOIN SBCES.EmployeeSalaries es ON es.WageGroup = ec.WageGroup
     WHERE 
            EL.LinkNumber = '035434'
            AND EL.TypeId = 'RB';
