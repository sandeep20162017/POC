You are ASP.NET core (8.0) and Telerik Kendo UI ASp.NET Core expert.
For the last tabIndex partial view tabUrlTotalCost,  if (currentGrid && (currentGrid.dataSource.hasChanges()))
currentGrid.dataSource.hasChanges() is always true. This partial vie has only read.
Is it possible to reset currentGrid.dataSource.hasChanges() to false in the beginning or sugeest any other property to us.
Thes are no JS errors and all the oother tabs ar working as expected.
