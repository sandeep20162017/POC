Hi Dennis,
Good morning!

We had a great discussion with Sal and Brent—I shared the RB estimation logic and design concepts, which sparked lots of positive input. Our 30-minute session turned into a 90-minute collaborative review (they were really engaged!). No major design changes are needed, just minor tweaks like adding a column and updating cost calculations (already approved by Andrew).

I also fine-tuned key business rules for RB and Vehicle estimates. With their feedback, I’ll keep progressing smoothly on CES development. Everything’s moving forward without delays!

Thanks!
