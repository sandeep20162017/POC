Hi Dennis
Good morning.
Had detailed discussions with Sal and Brent. Showcased both RB estimation logic and look and look an feel.
Receive positive response from both of them. No major design changes for estimates are anticipated. I will incorporate minor suggetions (like ad aitional column, recalculate cost based on overhead etc). This has alray been reviewed by Andrew.
I also carlied a few of the business rules relate to RB and Vehicle estimates.
Based on their inputs I will continue CES development.
No show stoppers.
Thank you
