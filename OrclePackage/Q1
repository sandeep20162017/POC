You are Oracle 19c and SQL server expert devloper and DbA.
I have following Oracle package :

create or replace PACKAGE CES_INQUIRY

AS TYPE query_cur IS REF CURSOR;
PROCEDURE SEARCH_RBPART
    (vi_orig_supplier_num IN RB_MASTERLIST.rebuilt_stock_num%TYPE,
     vi_oem_part_cost IN RB_MASTERLIST.estimated_cost%TYPE,
     vi_description IN RB_MASTERLIST.detailed_desc%TYPE,
     vi_keyword IN RB_MASTERLIST.keyword%TYPE,
     vi_cost_comparetype IN INTEGER,
     vo_Cursor OUT query_cur);

PROCEDURE RETRIEVE_ARCH_RB
    (vo_Cursor OUT query_cur);

What is the purpose of these packages? I don't see any stored procedure named SEARCH_RBPART, RETRIEVE_ARCH_RB
Oracle SQL  profiles looks like :

begin CES_INQUIRY.SEARCH_RBPART(VI_ORIG_SUPPLIER_NUM=>:V00001, VI_OEM_PART_COST=>:V00002, VI_DESCRIPTION=>:V00003, VI_KEYWORD=>:V00004, VI_COST_COMPARETYPE=>:V00005, VO_CURSOR=>:R000C000); end;

From the trace itis clear that CES_INQUIRY.SEARCH_RBPART is called, but I am still not clear which SQL statement or stored proc got called. I am new to Oracle. Explain how can use this logic if Oracle is to be replaced by SQL server.
