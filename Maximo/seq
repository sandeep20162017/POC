Oracle :

SELECT sequence_name
FROM all_sequences
WHERE sequence_name = 'DMSERIAL';

MS SQL :
SELECT name
FROM sys.sequences
WHERE name = 'DMSERIAL';

CREATE SEQUENCE dbo.DMSERIAL AS INT START WITH 100000 INCREMENT BY 1 NO CYCLE;

IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.DMSERIAL', 'SO') IS NOT NULL
    PRINT 'Sequence exists';
ELSE
    PRINT 'Sequence does not exist';


SQL Server does not automatically create or imply sequences like Oracle can with table.nextval.
